# mixed_messages
My "Mixed Messages" project for Codecademy

## What This Is
This project includes a website and node.js program. When a button is clicked or the program is run: 

* A very random phrase is generated using arrays and interpolation in Javascript.
* The color scheme changes, but always looks good thanks to a 2D array of matching color arrays.
* The fonts change.

This is my first ever personal project that is version controlled with Git using the commandline and Github.
